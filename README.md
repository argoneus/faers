FAERS data analysis
========

This is a tiny Python program and complementary bash script that leverages pyspark/Spark and HDFS for analysis of
adverse drug event data from the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System ([FAERS] (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/default.htm)).
Portions of this code were presented and discussed at the [2015 Oklahoma Supercomputing 
Symposium](http://symposium2015.oscer.ou.edu/speakers.html#davis).  Slides from the talk are [available](http://symposium2015.oscer.ou.edu/oksupercompsymp2015_talk_davis_20150923.pdf) for more
background.
